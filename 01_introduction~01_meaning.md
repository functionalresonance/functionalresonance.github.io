## The Meaning of FRAM

In the first presentations of FRAM, the acronym was used to mean Functional Resonance Accident Model.

It however soon became clear that FRAM was a method rather than a model, and the acronym now stands for Functional Resonance Analysis Method.

The acronym was also chosen because it means 'forward,' in Norwegian and Swedish.

FRAM is also the name of a ship that between 1893 and 1912 was used in expeditions of the Arctic and Antarctic regions by Fridtjov Nansen, Roald Amundsen, and other Norwegian explorers. FRAM is said to be the wooden ship to have sailed farthest north (85°57' N) and farthest south (78°41' S).
